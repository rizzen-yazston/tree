Rizzen Yazston

Welcome to the Tree project.

A simple generic tree structure containing data nodes. The `tree` crate provides the `Tree` struct and the `Node` trait.

As the `Tree` is generic in design, it mainly has methods for the manipulation of the tree structure, though does also provide convenient methods for directly accessing the various properties of the `Node`s.

The repository contains only the `tree` crate.

Note:: The crate on `crates.io` has its name appended with the suffix `-rizzen-yazston` to distinguish them from other tree creates by other authors.

== Usage

Simply include the `tree-rizzen-yazston` crate in the `Cargo.toml` to make it available to the application or library. Due to its simple design there is no configuration required.

=== Cargo.toml

```
[dependencies]
tree-rizzen-yazston = "0.0.0"
```

=== Examples

```
use tree::*;
```
